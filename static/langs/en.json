  "easyTutorialSentence1": "This tutorial will help you learn how to convert any scratch project you make into the Python programming language.",
  "easyTutorialSentence2": "This image below shows Dot the dog in his natural habitat which is...SCRATCH!",
  "easyTutorialSentence3": "Click on the code below if you want to learn how to make it yourself!",
  "easyTutorialSentence4": "Scratch is the world's largest free coding community for kids and is paving the way for the future of computer science.",
  "easyTutorialSentence5": "If it is your first time with scratch go to: ",
  "easyTutorialSentence6": "If you are new to scratch click Join Scratch else click Sign in.",
  "easyTutorialSentence7": "Now you can make your account and click create to create your project!",
  "easyTutorialSentence8": "You can start with the example above if you do not know where to start.",
  "easyTutorialSentence9": "Learning about how the conversion works",
  "easyTutorialSentence10": "This next image is part of this project converted into python.",
  "easyTutorialSentence11": "Can you find when the dog moves 10 steps in the python code and the scratch code?",
  "easyTutorialSentence12": "Here is an easy example of the conversion process!",
  "easyTutorialSentence13": "Learning Python code",
  "easyTutorialSentence14": "Self in the code below refers to the sprite we used in our program in this case our dog named Dot is our sprite.",
  "easyTutorialSentence15": "Self represents the instance of a class and in this case it represents our Dog named Dot at its current state.",
  "easyTutorialSentence16": "Self is then used to move the dog 10 steps and make him bark.",
  "easyTutorialSentence17": "defines a function that starts when the green flag is clicked so the code can run.",
  "easyTutorialSentence18": "The PyStage enviroment for every project is created in the code below",
  "easyTutorialSentence19": "This makes our program include sounds, images, variables, costumes and a stage.",
  "easyTutorialSentence20": "Can you find the line of code where pystage imports the stage and sprite?",
  "easyTutorialSentence21": "What is the number for center_y in 'dot_c'?",
  "easyTutorialSentence22": "Hint: Dot_c is a costume for dot that moves his legs when he moves.",
  "easyTutorialSentence23": "This program does not run without this last line of code at the end that calls the function when_program_starts_1 and starts the stage.",
  "easyTutorialSentence24": "I think you are learning!",
  "easyTutorialSentence25": "To use PyStage you first need to make a scratch project",
  "easyTutorialSentence26": "and save it to your computer or copy your project link.",
  "easyTutorialSentence27": "Errors that can happen when generating",
  "easyTutorialSentence28": "Error in generating file!",
  "easyTutorialSentence29": "This means that the website could not load the content for your project.",
  "easyTutorialSentence30": "Invalid URL or internal error!",
  "easyTutorialSentence31": "URL is incorrect or scratch is having server issues while you are generating your project.",
  "easyTutorialSentence32": "Unknown Error",
  "easyTutorialSentence33": "Most likely there is something not implemented yet that you used in your project.",
  "easyTutorialSentence34": "Keep in mind PyStage is in working development and not everything may work as intended yet.",
  "easyTutorialSentence35": "When your project is generated this box will show up explaining what PyStage has not implemented yet.",
  "easyTutorialSentence36": "Please go to",
  "easyTutorialSentence37": "if you have any issues to report with PyStage.",
  "easyTutorialSentence38": "Now that your project is converted into python the next step is to run your project with Visual Studio Code!",
  "easyTutorialSentence39": "If you do not have Visual Studio Code you can download it with this link ",
  "easyTutorialSentence40": "Download your code on our website.",
  "easyTutorialSentence41": "Take your zip file and unzip it by right-clicking the zip file and clicking",
  "extractHere": "extract here.",
  "easyTutorialSentence42": "Remember when you save your project on your computer what folder you put your project in.",
  "easyTutorialSentence43": "Navagate to your folder",
  "easyTutorialSentence44": "Go to Visual Studio Code and click file and Open Folder and open your unzipped folder.",
  "easyTutorialSentence45": "In the top left of your screen click terminal in Visual Studio Code.",
  "easyTutorialSentence46": "In the terminal navigate to your folder with your unzipped code by using the command cd",
  "easyTutorialSentence47": "Your file path may be different to mine, here is an example of my filepath.",
  "easyTutorialSentence48": "Downloading Python",
  "easyTutorialSentence49": "If you have not downloaded python before open Visual Studio Code and on the left side of your screen you should see a tab that is called extensions.",
  "easyTutorialSentence50": "Click extensions and then type Python and download what you see in the picture below.",
  "easyTutorialSentence51": "Requirements to pip install before you begin",
  "easyTutorialSentence52": "Open the terminal and pip install the following commands.",
  "easyTutorialSentence53": "For example run pip install wheel and continue to run pip install for everything on the list below.",
  "easyTutorialSentence54": "Finally after setting up your enviroment you can open your python code.",
  "easyTutorialSentence55": "Right-click inside the Python file editor and select Run Python File in Terminal to run the code and it should look like this.",
  "easyTutorialSentence56": "You could also in the terminal type Python pystagedog.py or whatever else you named your file.",
  "easyTutorialSentence57": "That is it! Enjoy your converted code!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence1": "This tutorial will take you through how to make a simple scratch game with a goal at the end!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence2": "There is one line of code missing in the image above from the game, can you guess what it is?",
  "mediumTutorialSentence3": "We will tell you the answer at the end of this tutorial.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence4": "For now lets go over each individual block of code and see what it does.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence5": "This block of code is executed when the green flag is clicked and it shows a message and resets the timer and score.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence6": "Click on events and drag when green flag is clicked to the script area.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence7": "Click on looks and drag the think block to the script area and write a message.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence8": "Click on sensing and drag reset timer to the script area.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence9": "Click on variables and drag set your_score to 0 to the script area.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence10": "Now I challenge you to find the rest of the blocks on your own!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence11": "This block of code is executed when the d key is pressed when you move right in the game.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence12": "If you are touching the Cheesy Puffs then a message pops up saying Yum!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence13": "You score then changes by 1 as long as you are touching the Cheesy Puffs",
  "mediumTutorialSentence14": "See how many points you can get before it disappears!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence15": "This code changes x by 10 or -10 based on if a or d is pressed on your keyboard.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence16": "A new costume is displayed for the cat to make the cat look like it is walking.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence17": "This code is used when the Cheesy Puffs touches Sprite1. (the cat)",
  "mediumTutorialSentence18": "When green flag is clicked",
  "mediumTutorialSentence19": "the Cheesy Puffs goes to the cordinates x: 150 and y: -130 in our game.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence20": "The size of the Cheesy Puffs is set to 100% to reset any size changes from past games.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence21": "When d key is pressed ",
  "mediumTutorialSentence22": "if the Cheesy Puffs are touching the cat then we wait 1 second.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence23": "In this one second try and get as many points as you can!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence24": "Then the size is set to 0% although this does not make the Cheesy Puffs completely dissapear off the screen.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence25": "We set the x and y cordinates to -1000 so you can not see the Cheesy Puffs on the screen.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence26": "When you press the green flag the x and y cordinates are reset to their original position."
