There is one line of code missing in the image above from the game, can you guess what it is?


We will tell you the answer at the end of this tutorial.


For now lets go over each individual block of code and see what it does.


<img src="{{prefix}}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/catCode1.png') }}" id = "catCode1" alt="catCode1" width="600px" />


This block of code is executed when the green flag is clicked and it shows a message and resets the timer and score.


Click on events and drag when green flag is clicked to the script area.


Click on looks and drag the think block to the script area and write a message.


Click on sensing and drag reset timer to the script area.


Click on variables and drag set your_score to 0 to the script area.


Now I challenge you to find the rest of the blocks on your own!

<img src="{{prefix}}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/catCode2.png') }}" id = "catCode2" alt="catCode2" width="600px" />


This block of code is executed when the d key is pressed when you move right in the game.


If you are touching the Cheesy Puffs then a message pops up saying Yum!


You score then changes by 1 as long as you are touching the Cheesy Puffs


See how many points you can get before it disappears!

<img src="{{prefix}}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/catCode3.png') }}" id = "catCode3" alt="catCode3" width="600px" />


This code changes x by 10 or -10 based on if a or d is pressed on your keyboard.


A new costume is displayed for the cat to make the cat look like it is walking.
