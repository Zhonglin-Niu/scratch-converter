 <b>Can you think of a way you would improve this game to make it better for a user playing the game?</b>
 
 
 The three sprites in this project are the squirrel, donuts and squirrel2.
 
 
 We will go through each sprite one by one.


 Here is the code for the squirrel sprite.

 <img src="{{prefix}}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/squirrelCode1.png') }}" id = "squirrelCode1" alt="squirrelCode1" width="600px" />

 
 This code block makes the squirrel win after he eats over 100 donuts.
 
 
 <b>When any key is pressed</b> if donuts is greater then 100 we loop the following forever.


We set the size to 1000%, the backdrop switches to stars and all other commands are stopped.


This code makes the squirrel lose after 30 seconds of play time.


<b>When any key is pressed</b> if donuts is less then 100 then we wait until the timer is greater then 30 seconds.


We then switch backdrop to stars and stop all other commands.


<b>When any key is pressed</b> if the squirrel is touching a Donut then we change the Donuts score by 1


If the Donuts score is greater then 20 then shrink the squirrel to 30% the size and say a message.


 <img src="{{prefix}}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/squirrelCode2.png') }}" id = "squirrelCode2" alt="squirrelCode2" width="600px" />


 <b>When green flag is clicked</b> reset Donuts score to 0, reset the size of the squirrel and the backdrop.


We say a message for 5 seconds and then say another message explaining the controls of the game.


The message explaining the controls stops when the score is over 20 because we then say our hard mode message in the first code image above.

Find this message: Hard Mode! I need 100 donuts!


<b>When backdrop switches to stars</b> if the Donuts score is less then 100 then say


You Lose, I'm Hungry!


Else if Donuts is greater then 100 then say


Yum! I am Done!


If Donuts equals 100 then in our code this mean you still lose the game and no message is displayed.


<b>What message would you put in the code if the squirrels Donuts equals 100?</b>


 <img src="{{prefix}}{{ url_for('static', filename='img/squirrelCode3.png') }}" id = "squirrelCode3" alt="squirrelCode3" width="600px" />
 
 This code executes the controls for the squirrel.


 If you press w you go up and if you press s you go down.


 If you press a you go left and if you press d you go right.
